# 📅 TA Scheduling Optimization Using Power BI

This project analyzes and optimizes the Teaching Assistant (TA) scheduling system at the Kelley School of Business using interactive Power BI dashboards. By exploring patterns in booking behaviors, time slot popularity, and appointment utilization, the project offers data-driven recommendations to improve academic support services and operational efficiency.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify underutilized TA time slots and peak demand periods.
- Analyze appointment cancellations, lead times, and day-wise availability.
- Propose adaptive scheduling, flexible booking, and walk-in models.
- Support strategic TA resource allocation based on real-time and historical trends.

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Evening slots (2:30–4:00 PM)** are most preferred by students.
- **Tuesday** sees excessive availability despite low demand.
- High cancellation rates occur for appointments booked **more than 7 days in advance**, especially in afternoon slots.
- **70% of slots remained unbooked**, signaling resource misallocation.

---

## 🧠 Recommendations

- 📌 Shift TA availability toward **Thursday–Saturday**, aligning with student workload timelines.
- 🕒 Introduce **rolling/limited advance booking** to reduce cancellations.
- 💡 Implement a **flexible scheduling platform** with real-time updates and feedback integration.
- 🚶‍♂️ Pilot a **walk-in clinic model** during peak hours to minimize unused slots.

## 📈 Tools Used

- **Power BI** for interactive dashboards and time-based analytics
- **Excel / CSV** datasets as the backend
- Descriptive analytics and theoretical modeling for actionable insights

## 🔍 Summary

This project highlights how strategic use of visual analytics in Power BI can transform inefficient scheduling systems into adaptive, student-centric solutions. The results promote better TA utilization, fewer missed opportunities, and a more supportive academic environment.
